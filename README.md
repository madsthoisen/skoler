# Skoler

This provides a simple dashboard for visualizing and comparing the grouped well-being indicators for Danish schools, as well as average grades. The statistics are obtained from Børne- og Undervisningsministeriets Uddannelsesstatistik ([trivsel](https://uddannelsesstatistik.dk/Pages/Reports/1599.aspx), [karakterer](https://uddannelsesstatistik.dk/Pages/Reports/1802.aspx)). For each school, we include the average responses grouped by the categories of the well-being questionnaire, and for the grades, we include the averages over all grades from 2012/2013 to 2019/2020 (without taking into account yearly variation in nationwide grade averages).
